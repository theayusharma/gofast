# GoFast - Speed Test TUI

A terminal-based speed test application built with Go and Bubble Tea that tests your internet speed using fast.com API.

## Installation

You can try downloading it from the releases

## Why I made this??

i made this because i didnâ€™t want to use my browser just to know my internet speed, so i used fastdotcom cli. but then i was missing the fancy gui they provide while it runs the test, so to implement this and have something to watch while doing the speed test, i made a fast wrapper with some sort of tui. i can't make something like cloudflare speed test for the terminal, but yeah, this is the initial one.
